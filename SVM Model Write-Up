# SVM Model Write-Up
- Uses support vectors to identify patterns in data and make predictions based off it
- Uses boundaries by finding the best decision boundary between groups of data
- Maximizes margin between boundary and support vectors (data points closest to decision boundary)
- Uses regression to predict future values for stock prices
- Predicts and plots future stock prices

## Our SVM Model cleans data by reversing/converting the data in rows & columns to put it in order and optimize it for data analysis.
Splitting Data
- Next, it splits the data into training and testing sets, and scales it.
Training the Model
- 
Predicting & Plotting
- The model makes predictions based on the testing data, and plots the predicted values vs. the actual values to display the accuracy of the model on a graph.
Evaluation
- Next, we evaluate the data using several metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error, mean error, coefficient of determination).

## Results of testing the SVM Model:
