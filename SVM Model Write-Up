- Uses support vectors to identify patterns in data and make predictions based off it
- Uses boundaries by finding the best decision boundary between groups of data
- Maximizes margin between boundary and support vectors (data points closest to decision boundary)
- Uses regression to predict future values for stock prices
- Predicts and plots future stock prices

## Results of testing the SVM Model:
