#SVM Model Write-Up
##SVM Model Description
- Uses support vectors to identify patterns in data and make predictions based off it
- Uses boundaries by finding the best decision boundary between groups of data
- Maximizes margin between boundary and support vectors (data points closest to decision boundary)
- Uses regression to predict future values for stock prices
- We chose the regression model because it was more ideal for predicting future data, as opposed to classification which is more ideal for grouping/categorizing data

##Steps
Cleaning Data
- Model cleans data by reversing/converting the data in rows & columns to put it in order and optimize it for data analysis.
- Rows are reversed to put dates in order.
- "Date" column is converted to a datetime object to allow for time-based operations.
- Columns are categorized based on appropriate descriptions (volume, opening price (open), closing price (close/last), high, low).
- Dollar sign is removed and the data in all price columns are converted to float.
Splitting Data
- Splits the data into training and testing sets, and scales it. Uses the first 80% of the data to test and the remaining 20% to test. 
Training the Model
- Model is trained using support vector regression used to predict numerical values.
Predicting & Plotting
- Makes predictions based on the testing data, and plots the predicted values vs. the actual values to display the accuracy of the model on a graph.
Evaluation
- Evaluates the accuracy of the model's predictions using several metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error, mean error, coefficient of determination).
