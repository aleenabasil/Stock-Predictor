General set up:

1. Download Amazon stock prices dataset

2. Data preprocessing
- Cleaning, evaluating, manipulating data so the model will be able to utilize the output
- Handle missing values, outliers, duplicates
- Improve quality of data and normalize it
- Exploratory data analysis to find trends

3. Create training and test sets

4. Create initial ML model -- in groups of 2
- LSTM 
- Random Forest
- SVM

5. New group of 2, familiarize each other with your ML model and get it running on your machine

6. Model evaluation: validation / testing / plotting / comparison with each other and actual stock prices
- Calculate RMSE
- Best hyperparameters 
- Plot confusion matrix
- Figure out how to prevent overfitting of model

7. Write functions to predict future stock prices for each model
- For each model, choose best model and predict the next 10 days
- Calculate accuracy
- Plot actual vs predicted prices

8. Choose best model(s)

9. Write report

10. Create presentation, practice, present!
