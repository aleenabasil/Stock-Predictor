- Download stock prices dataset
- Decide on a specific stock / few stocks
    EX: uses microsoft MSFT, general method:
    Download from yahoo finance
- Explore data
- Setup dataset to predict future prices
  - Test machine learning model
- Set up back testing engine
  - Improve accuracy
  - Document future directions to further improve technique
- Create a machine learning model
  - Predict future stock prices (tomorrows closing price using todays data)
  - Buy stock if model predicts price increase
  - Do nothing if price will go down
  - Maximize true positives: days model predicts price will go up and it actually foes
  - Precision as error metric: true + / (False + plus true +)
- Think about application to the real world
